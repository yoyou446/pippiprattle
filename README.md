# Pippi Prattle
Pippi Prattle is a multiuse tool used to extract the time/location of samples/data in audio files. 


## Overview

The program allows you to open an audio file (e.g. WAV, MP3). While playing the audio file hitting a preprogrammed key will record the position of the sample in the audio. When done the program will return a list of timestamps that'll correspond to where the samples are found in the audio file. 

## History

While this program has wide potential uses I'm building it for one use. I have a friend who's writing her thesis on otters and is manually listening to audio and every time she hears a sample needs to stop and manual record its time in the audio file. Pippi is the name of one of the Otters and shes studying their vocalisation. Hents the name Prattle.
